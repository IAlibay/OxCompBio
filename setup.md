The Oxford Computational Biochemistry course contains 4 self-contained tutorials which each have different software installation requirements. These instructions can be found in the respective folder's `setup.md`. Here we provide some basic instructions on the base setup requirements common to these tutorials and how to obtain a local copy of the materials.

All tutorials in this course rely heavily on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager. This cross platform tool allows you to install other software packages in an easy and controllable manner. We require all attendees to install this prior to starting any of the tutorials. Please see the follow the [Anaconda install instructions to get started](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager, is named [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Throughout the tutorials you will see several invocations of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), including to create [environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-envs) and install software. If you are unfamiliar with this tool, it is heavily recommened that you go through the [getting started guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).
