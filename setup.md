# Setup instructions for the Oxford Computational Biochemistry course

The Oxford Computational Biochemistry course contains 4 self-contained tutorials which each have different software installation requirements. These instructions can be found in the respective folder's `setup.md`. Here we provide some basic instructions on the base setup requirements common to these tutorials and how to obtain a local copy of the materials.

## 1. Downloading a local copy of the course materials

## 2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

All tutorials in this course rely heavily on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager. This cross platform tool allows you to install other software packages in an easy and controllable manner. We require all attendees to install this prior to starting any of the tutorials. Please see the follow the [Anaconda install instructions to get started](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager, is named [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Throughout the tutorials you will see several invocations of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), including to create [environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-envs) and install software. If you are unfamiliar with this tool, it is heavily recommened that you go through the [getting started guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

## 3. Using the terminal

## 4. [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

The tutorials rely on the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to provide an interactive experience, particularly when dealing with python code. The install instructions for each tutorial will install a copy of the jupyter notebook interface where required. We recommend that you start by setting up the [python tutorial](./tutorials/Python/setup.md) and then look at some of the following resources on how to use notebooks:

- [The jupyter notebook beginners guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
- [Codeacademy's jupyter notebook tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks)
- [Quick introduction to jupyter notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI) (youtube video)
